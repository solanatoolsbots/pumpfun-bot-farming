# FAQ

**Does it work with any SOL token?**

While our videos focus mostly on token creators, it is totally possible to use it with any token from pump.fun and raydium. Choose "Farm Token" from the console and enter the CA addresse, if the token is not yet trading you can snipe some initial supply on launch, and farming a token is always possible with already launched token.
